# Logistic_Regression
Logistic regression is a data analysis technique that uses mathematics to find the relationships between two data factors. It then uses this relationship to predict the value of one of those factors based on the other. The prediction usually has a finite number of outcomes, like yes or no.

# Why logistic regression being a classification algorithm is called" regression" ?
Logistic regression is called "regression" because it is a type of regression analysis, which is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In the case of logistic regression, the dependent variable is categorical (i.e., it takes on discrete values) and the independent variables can be either continuous or categorical.

Although logistic regression is commonly used as a classification algorithm (i.e., to predict the probability of a binary outcome), it is still technically a regression analysis because it involves fitting a regression model to the data. Specifically, logistic regression models the logarithm of the odds ratio of the dependent variable given the independent variables.

So, while the term "regression" might seem odd in the context of a classification algorithm, it is used because logistic regression is fundamentally a type of regression analysis.
